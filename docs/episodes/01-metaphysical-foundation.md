## Questions
- What is "metaphysical programming"?
- How do condensation and rarefaction differ from traditional development?
- What problems does COHEREX solve?

## Objectives
- Define condensation, rarefaction, and architectural grids
- Explain the Red-Green-Refactor cycle as a metaphysical breath
- Identify rigidity in existing codebases

## Keypoints
- Condensation transforms potential into working code
- Rarefaction releases rigidity while preserving knowledge
- Every commit should complete a full condensation-rarefaction cycle
